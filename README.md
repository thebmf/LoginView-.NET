# VB.NET Login and Registration Form 🚪🔐
This repository contains a simple yet functional login and registration form system developed in Visual Basic .NET, demonstrating fundamental user authentication processes. This application interfaces with a MySQL database, managed through XAMPP, to handle user data.

## Features 🌟
User Registration: New users can create an account by providing a username and password. The system also includes a password confirmation field for validation.

User Login: Existing users can log in using their credentials. The form includes a "Show password" feature for convenience. 👀

MySQL Database Integration: User credentials are stored and managed in a MySQL database.
