# VB.NET Login and Registration Form
This repository contains a simple yet functional login and registration form system developed in Visual Basic .NET, demonstrating fundamental user authentication processes. This application interfaces with a MySQL database, managed through XAMPP, to handle user data.

## Features
User Registration: New users can create an account by providing a username and password. The system also includes a password confirmation field for validation.
User Login: Existing users can log in using their credentials. The form includes a "Show password" feature for convenience.
MySQL Database Integration: User credentials are stored and managed in a MySQL database.

Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
Ensure XAMPP servers are running and the MySQL database is configured as mentioned above.
